**Note:** Ignore the numbers on the outside of the Arduino symbol and refer to the numbers within the box for pin connections (i.e. D2, D3, A0, etc.)  All capacitor values are in microfarads (uF), unless otherwise stated.  No values are super critical and typical tolerance components may be used.  1K ohm resistors are better suited than the 100 ohm transistor base resistors shown in the schematic.  Use 1k resistors; I am in the process of updating the schematic.

These [detailed building plans by KF4BZT](https://kf4bzt.wordpress.com/2015/08/06/arduino-cw-keyer-project/) may be helpful to people new to building this sort of thing.

This [Fritzing Breadboard Plan](http://fritzing.org/media/fritzing-repo/projects/k/k3ng-project/images/K3NG%20keyer_bb.png) may also help in breadboarding your first prototype.
