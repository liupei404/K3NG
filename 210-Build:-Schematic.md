**Note:** Ignore the numbers on the outside of the Arduino symbol and refer to the numbers within the box for pin connections (i.e. D2, D3, A0, etc.)  All capacitor values are in microfarads (uF), unless otherwise stated.  No values are super critical and typical tolerance components may be used.  1K ohm resistors are better suited than the 100 ohm transistor base resistors shown in the schematic.  Use 1k resistors; I am in the process of updating the schematic.

# Arduino Nano Keyer

Marc-Andre, VE2EVN, created this schematic for his keyer build using an Arduino Nano.
