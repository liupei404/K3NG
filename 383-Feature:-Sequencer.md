The K3NG Arduino CW keyer has TX/RX sequencer output functionality.  This is useful for stations that have devices external to transceivers such as linear amplifiers, LNAs, and T/R switches.  Proper sequencing and timing during T/R switching is often crucial to avoid equipment damage.

The keyer offers five sequencer outputs, in addition to the PTT line.  The PTT line
