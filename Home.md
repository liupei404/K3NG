Full documentation for the K3NG Arduino CW Keyer is located [here](http://blog.radioartisan.com/arduino-cw-keyer/). It is being moved over to the wiki, but this is not yet complete

***

The K3NG Keyer is an open source Arduino based CW (Morse Code) keyer with a lot of features and flexibility, rivaling commercial keyers which often cost significantly more.  The code can be used with a full blown Arduino board or an AVR microcontroller chip can be programmed and used directly in a circuit.  This keyer is suitable as a standalone keyer or for use permanently installed inside a rig, especially homebrew QRP rigs.  It’s open source code so you can fully customize it to fit your needs and also perhaps learn from it or find coding ideas for other projects.  

A circuit board and parts kits called the nanoKeyer is available from DJ0MY, and Hamshop offers a kit called Open CW Keyer which uses this software.  RemoteQTH also offers the Open Interface which runs this code.
