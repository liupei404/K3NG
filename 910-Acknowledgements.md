# Hardware, Extensions, User Contributions, Other Support Sources, Etc.

Oscar, DJ0MY, [offers a hardware kit](http://nanokeyer.wordpress.com/nanokeyer-info/), utilizing an Arduino Nano (user supplied).  The kit features a speed potentiometer, opto-isolated TX and PTT outputs, three memory buttons, and a PS2 keyboard connector.  Oscar provided testing, especially for the K1EL Winkey interface protocol emulation, and numerous development ideas.

Dietmar, DL2SBA, [has created some extensions to the hardware](http://dl2sba.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=131:nanokeyer&catid=15:shack&Itemid=27#english), including button switch banks.

Marc, F6ITU, has created [a Wiki page (En Francais)](http://wiki.electrolab.fr/Projets:Perso:2012:ArduiKeyer) describing the keyer project and plans for an Arduino shield.  There is also an alternate patch PS2 keyboard library for European/French(?) keyboard localization.

Hajos Kontrapunkte [wrote about his experience](http://hajos-kontrapunkte.blogspot.com/2012/04/arduino-k3ng-cw-keyer-and-lcd-shield.html) building the keyer.

_**If you contributed and I’ve failed to list you above, please email me!**_

I would like to give **special thanks** to the staff of an unnamed popular contest logging program for refusing to provide any help in implementing a certain feature and prompting me to create a better technical solution with others who were willing to help.
