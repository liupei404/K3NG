The K3NG Arduino Keyer will not work with Logger16, Logger32, Logger64, Logger128, and Logger256.  I haven’t tested Logger1024 or Logger2048, but it probably doesn’t work with them either.  Attempts to interface this keyer to any version of Logger may result in your Arduino board smoking or perhaps bursting into flames.  Contact the (un)friendly support people on the Logger Yahoo Group for help with this issue.  Be sure to drink a Lager or 32 afterwards.
