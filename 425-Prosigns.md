### Prosigns

Custom prosigns can be sent using \+ in the CLI or in memories as a macro.  Several “hard wired” / common prosigns are available for various keys on the PS2 keyboard like =, -, &, etc. and the Sroll Lock key can be used to create custom prosigns on the fly.

If you are programming a memory in command mode using the paddle, the \+ macro can be used to create prosigns.  The \ is six dahs ( – – – – – – ) and + is didahdidahdit ( . – . – . ).  Common prosigns AR, BK, and SK are automatically recognized and do not need to be proceeded with a \+ macro, just send the prosign as you normally would (AR would be didahdidahdit, not didah didahdit).
