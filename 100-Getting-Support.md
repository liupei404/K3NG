## Support

Please consult [this page](http://blog.radioartisan.com/support-for-k3ng-projects/) for support information.  Feature requests and bug reports are documented and tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/k3ng/k3ng_cw_keyer/issues).

I encourage you to experiment with the code, customize it, learn from it, and have fun.  That’s what amateur radio is all about.  However, if you’re a novice programmer, please don’t ask me to work on your hacked up code to implement some specific application you’re looking for.  If you would like for me to develop code for a specific piece of hardware or a device, you may be able to interest me in doing this by sending me a piece of hardware (free) to develop with and use.

I am not an expert or professional programmer.  I tend to write readable code with sufficient though often sparse comments.  (Good code shouldn’t need a lot of comments.) I avoid complexities that some hotshot C or C++ programmers may do as the goal here is to have fun, not show off how obfuscated I can make my code.  Undoubtedly there are better or more efficient ways to do some things in the code.

Have fun!
